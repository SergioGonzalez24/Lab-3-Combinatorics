**Solve the following two problems.**

1 -.An **n**-permutation with repetition of **m** objects is a way of selecting **n** objects from a list of size **m**m. The selection rules are:

* The order of selection matters (the same **n**n objects selected in different orders are regarded as different **n**n-permutations).
* Each object can be selected more than once.


2 -.A combination with repetition of **n**n objects from **m**m is a way of selecting **n**n objects from a list of size **m**m. The selection rules are:

* The order of selection does not matter (the same objects selected in different orders are regarded as the same combination).
* Each object can be selected more than once.
